  <div class="about-body">
    <p>
      I am a network engineer and cybersecurity practitioner with a focus on offensive security, homelab design,
      and automation. I enjoy building realistic lab environments, tearing systems apart to see how they work,
      and then using what I learn to improve security and reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests cover network architecture, penetration testing, cloud and on premises automation, and AI assisted
      workflows for both technical and operational tasks. Most of the work here started as something I needed in my
      own environment, then grew into a reusable tool or repeatable process.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to talk about security testing, network design, or using AI to augment technical work, you can reach
      me through GitHub or whatever contact method I add here later.
